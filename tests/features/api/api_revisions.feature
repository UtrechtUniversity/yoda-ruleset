Feature: Revisions API

    Scenario: Search revisions on file name
        Given user "<user>" is authenticated
        And the Yoda revision API is queried with "<filename>"
	    Then the response status code is "200"
	    And "<revision_search_result>" is found

        Examples:
        | user       | filename      | revision_search_result |
	    | researcher | SIPI          | SIPI_Jelly_Beans       |


    Scenario: Find actual revisions for one particular data object
        Given user "<user>" is authenticated
        Given the Yoda revision API is queried with "<path>"
	    Then the response status code is "200"
	    And revisions list is found

        Examples:
        | user       | path                                                                  |
        | researcher | /tempZone/home/research-initial/testdata/SIPI_Jelly_Beans_4.1.07.tiff |


    Scenario: Restore a revision
        Given user "<user>" is authenticated
        And the Yoda revision API is requested for first revision for "<path>"
        And the Yoda revision API is requested to restore revision in collection "<coll_target>" with name "<new_filename>" with revision id
	    Then the response status code is "200"
	    And revision is restored successfully

       Examples:
        | user       | path                                                                  | coll_target                       | new_filename            |
        | researcher | /tempZone/home/research-initial/testdata/SIPI_Jelly_Beans_4.1.07.tiff | /tempZone/home/research-revisions | SIPI_Jelly_Beans_2.tiff |
