            | datamanager | datamanager-initial |

    Scenario: Group data filtered
        Given user "<user>" is authenticated
        And the Yoda group data filtered API is queried with "<user>" and "<zone>"
        Then the response status code is "200"
        And group "<group>" exists

        Examples:
            | user        | zone     | group               |
            | researcher  | tempZone | research-initial    |
            | researcher  | tempZone | research-initial1   |
            | datamanager | tempZone | datamanager-initial |

    Scenario: Group categories
        Given user "<user>" is authenticated
        And the Yoda group categories API is queried
        Then the response status code is "200"

            | datamanager | initial  |

    Scenario: Group subcategories
        Given user "<user>" is authenticated
        And the Yoda group subcategories API is queried with "<category>"
        Then the response status code is "200"

            | datamanager  | functional | functionaladmingroup#tempZone, functionaladmincategory#tempZone, functionaladminpriv#tempZone |
            | datamanager  | tech       | technicaladmin#tempZone                                                                       |
