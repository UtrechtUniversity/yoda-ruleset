  "help": "Checks if the files in the data folder and subfolders comply with the DANS guidelines for preferred file formats as per 1-Aug-2019. Their guidelines states that the preferred file formats offer the best long-term guarantees in terms of usability, accessibility and sustainability. For more information see https://dans.knaw.nl/. Disclaimer: Please note that Yoda currently deducts the file format from the filename. It does not inspect the file content.",
  "advice": "For files that do not comply with preferred formats, we recommend that you include in the data package a specification of the file format. Should you want to reference an external specification document then try to find a sustainable link, ideally use a DOI.  If feasible, also include in a separate folder of your data package a copy of the file transformed into of the preferred formats.  Please consult a datamanager or consult the Research Support desk (see https://www.uu.nl/rdm) in case you need any assistance.",
