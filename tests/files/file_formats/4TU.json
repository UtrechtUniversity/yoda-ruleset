  "help": "Checks if the files in the data folder and subfolders comply with the 4TU Centre for Research Data guidelines for preferred file formats as per 1-Aug-2019. Their guidelines states that usage of the preferred file formats is of essential importance in order to ensure that the research data will remain usable in the future. For more information see https://researchdata.4tu.nl/. Disclaimer: Please note that Yoda currently deducts the file format from the filename. It does not inspect the file content.",
  "advice": "For files that do not comply with preferred formats, we recommend that you include in the data package a specification of the file format. Should you want to reference an external specification document then try to find a sustainable link, ideally use a DOI.  If feasible, also include in a separate folder of your data package a copy of the file transformed into of the preferred formats.  Please consult a datamanager or consult the Research Support desk (see https://www.uu.nl/rdm) in case you need any assistance.",
