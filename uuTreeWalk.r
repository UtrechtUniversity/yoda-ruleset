# \brief Walks through a collection tree and calls an arbitrary rule for each tree-item.
#
# \param[in] direction           can be "forward" or "reverse"
#                                forward means process collection itself, then children
#                                reverse means process children first
#                                reverse is useful e.g. to delete collection trees
# \param[in] topLevelCollection  pathname of the root of the tree, must be collection
#                                NB: the root itself is also processed
# \param[in] ruleToProcess       name of the rule that can perform an action on tree items
#                                Requirement: rule must be preloaded in rulebase
#                                The rule should expect the following parameters:
#                                  itemParent  = full iRODS path to the parent of this object
#                                  itemName  = basename of collection or dataobject
#                                  itemIsCollection = true if the item is a collection
#                                  buffer = in/out Key-Value variable
#                                       the buffer is maintained by treewalk and passed
#                                       on to the processing rule. can be used by the rule
#                                       to communicate data to subsequent rule invocations
#                                       buffer."error" can be updated by the rule to indicate
#                                       an error, the treewalk will stop
# \param[in/out] buffer          an arbitrary buffer variable that is passed on to the rule
# \param[out] error             error result as may be set by the rule that is processed
#                                  a value of 0 means no error
#                                  other values indicate an error and process is interrupted
