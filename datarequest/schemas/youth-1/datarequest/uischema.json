Please see https://psyarxiv.com/hvfmr/ for complete details.\n\nReligiosity (IV): Religiosity is measured using a newly created scale with a subset of items from the Religion and Spirituality module of the 2004 mail survey. The scale includes general questions about how religious/spiritual the individual is and how important religion/spirituality is to them. The specific variables are as follows:\n\nil001rer: How religious are you?\nil002rer: How spiritual are you?\nil003rer: How important is religion in your life?\nil004rer: How important is spirituality in your life?\nil005rer: How important was it, or would it have been if you had children, to send your children for religious or spiritual instruction?\nil006rer: How closely do you identify with being a member of a religious group?\n\nThe levels of all of these variables are indicated by a Likert scale with the following options: (1) Not at all; (2) Not very; (3) Somewhat; (4) Very; (5) Extremely, as well as ‘System Missing’ (the participant did not provide an answer) and ‘Refused’ (the participant refused to answer the question). Variable il006rer additionally includes the option ‘Don’t know’ (the participant stated that they did not know how to answer the question). We will use the average score (after omitting non-numeric and ‘Don’t know’ responses) on the variables as a measure of religiosity. \n\nProsociality (DV): We will use three measures of prosociality that measure three aspects of engagement in other oriented activities. The prosociality variables come from the Volunteering module of the 2004 phone survey. \n\ngv103re: Did the graduate do volunteer work in the last 12 months? \n\nThis dichotomous variable assesses whether or not the participant has engaged in any volunteering activities in the last 12 months. The levels of this variable are yes/no. Yes will be coded as ‘1’, no will be coded as ‘0’."

As we are not interested in a specific group of Wisconsin people, we will not exclude any participants from our analyses. However, only 7,265 participants filled out the questions on prosociality and the number of siblings in the phone survey and only 6,845 filled out the religiosity items in the mail survey (Herd et al., 2014). This corresponds to a response rate of 73% and 69% respectively. Because we do not know whether the participants that did the mail survey also did the phone survey, our minimum expected sample size is 10,317 * 0.73 * 0.69 = 5,297."

Based on normally distributed data, we expect that 2.1% of the data points will be removed this way, leaving 1,358 out of 1,387 participants for the binary regression with gv103re as the outcome variable and 1,086 out of 1,109 participants, and 1,041 out of 1,063 participants for the linear regressions with gv109re and gv111re as the outcome variables, respectively."

Because previous research (on other datasets) shows a positive association between agreeableness and religiosity (Saroglou, 2002) there may be an effect of the agreeableness variable on our hypothesized association between religiosity and prosociality. To account for this effect we will include agreeableness in our analysis as a control variable. We did not find any associations between prosociality and the other Big Five variables."

For each, we will run a directional null hypothesis significance test to see whether a positive effect exists of religiosity on prosociality. For the first outcome (gv103re: Did the graduate do volunteer work in the last 12 months?) we will run a logistic regression with religiosity, the number of siblings, agreeableness, religious affiliation, and the interaction between religiosity and religious affiliation as predictors.\n\nFor the second and third outcomes (gv109re: Number of graduate’s other volunteer activities in the past 12 months; gv111re: How many hours did the graduate volunteer during a typical month in the last 12 months?) we will run two separate linear regressions with religiosity, the number of siblings, agreeableness, religious affiliation, and the interaction between religiosity and religious affiliation as predictors.\n\nIf the regression coefficient of the interaction between religiosity and religious affiliation is statistically significant from zero in any of the regressions, we will also carry out subgroup analyses for those particular regressions in line with our second hypothesis. This subgroup analysis involves running the regressions separately for each of the following groups: Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and followers of the United Church of Christ.\n\nThe code we will use for all these analyses can be found at https://osf.io/e3htr"

This means that a one-unit increase on the religiosity scale would be associated with a 1.05 factor change in odds of having done volunteering work in the last 12 months versus not having done so.\n\nFor the linear regressions with ‘The number of graduate’s volunteer activities in the last 12 months”, and “How many hours did the graduate volunteer during a typical month in the last 12 months?’ as the outcome variables, the minimum regression coefficients of interest of the religiosity variables are 0.05 and 0.5, respectively. This means that a one-unit increase in the religiosity scale would be associated with 0.05 extra volunteering activities in the last 12 months and with 0.5 more hours of volunteering work in the last 12 months.\n\nAll of these smallest effect sizes of interest are based on our own intuition."

For the linear regressions we additionally assumed the variance explained by the predictor to be 0.2 and the residual variance to be 1.0.
